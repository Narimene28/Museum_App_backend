4. Project Overview : 
Provide a description of the proposed project and outline the expected results. 

We propose the development of a comprehensive Museum App for Turkey, designed to provide users with a one-stop solution for all their museum-related needs. This application will offer an extensive list of museums available throughout Turkey, along with essential information such as general descriptions of the museum's contents, operating hours, ticket prices, and user reviews. To enhance the user experience, the app will include a feature allowing users to gauge the current capacity and crowdedness of the museums, represented by a simple bar indicator with. Users will have the ability to leave comments and reviews, as well as share their experiences through photos. Furthermore, users will have the option to choose between a Dark Theme and a Light Theme for an optimal viewing experience. This Museum App aims to make exploring and enjoying Turkey's rich cultural heritage a seamless and delightful experience for all visitors and locals.

Why is it important or useful that this system be built? What benefits will result? 

The development of our museum app holds significant importance and utility in various aspects. First and foremost, it simplifies the process of accessing comprehensive information about museums across Turkey, providing users with valuable insights into these cultural institutions. Moreover, our app empowers users to contribute to the cultural discourse by leaving reviews and ratings for museums, thus aiding fellow visitors in making informed choices regarding their cultural excursions. Beyond the individual user experience, this app plays a pivotal role in promoting and preserving Turkey's rich cultural heritage. By facilitating easy access and fostering greater understanding of the country's museums, it is poised to attract more local and international visitors, consequently bolstering the tourism industry and supporting the long-term preservation of Turkey's cultural treasures.

4. Objective and Scope of the project : 
Give a brief outline of what the project will aim to achieve upon completion and list the main project targets. 

To be a one-stop application for users to find more information about the museums in Turkey.

How many end-points are you planning at backend and what are they? 

The estimation for the endpoints implementation for the project is as follows: 
'Museums' module, around five endpoints will be outlined, encompassing functionalities such as 'GetAll' to retrieve all museums, 'GetById' to fetch a specific museum, and 'GetByCategory' to filter museums by category. 
'Comments' module, around five endpoints has been proposed, comprising 'Post' and 'Put' for adding and updating comments, 'GetAll' and 'GetById' for retrieving comments, and 'Delete' for removing specific comments as required. 
These planned endpoints lay the foundation for robust and efficient data management and interaction within the system, ensuring smooth operations and seamless user experiences.

How many screens will your mobile application contain? You may provide some mock-up screens designs and a navigation diagram. 

Our mobile application will consist of two key screens, each tailored to enhance the user's experience and provide a seamless interface for exploring museums in Turkey. These screens include:

a. Home Screen: This serves as the app's central hub, presenting users with a list of museums. The Home Screen will feature various filters and recommendations to help users navigate through the museum options effectively. Here, users can easily search for museums either by location or by name. It will simplify the process of finding specific museums or exploring those in particular areas.

b. Museum Detail Screen: This screen provides comprehensive information about a selected museum, including photos, detailed descriptions, and a section for reviews and comments. Users can gain a deeper understanding of a museum's offerings and contribute to the community by sharing their thoughts.

To facilitate a visual understanding of the app's structure, we will provide mock-up screen designs and a navigation diagram to ensure clarity and ease of use for our users.
